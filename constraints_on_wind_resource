This is the model with the contraints placed on the wind resource to observe the changes on the energy  system. The contraints we as follows: 

One contraint
Only the Carbon dioxide emissions 
Scenario 1 Constraint on the CO2 emmisions in tonnes of CO2
500,000
Unrestricted 

scenario 2 
100,000
Partial 

Senario 3 
50,000
High restriction

New model 
New scenarios with two contraints 
Constraints were placed on the carbon dioixde emmisions and the wind capacity potentials



scenario- 1 with two constraints were as followed- a high constraint was placed on the carbon dioxide and the wind potential

Carbon dioxide emission 
10,000 tonnes of CO2

80% the peak demand (MW) 
164

The reduction and containt placed on the wind potential (MW)
310

The composition of the wind potnetial after the contraint was placed were as followed:

This is the scenario that is in the data file of the model that was uploaded to github.



Scenario 2 with two contraints were as followed: relaxed/low CO2 constraint and a high constraint on the wind potential

Carbon dioxide emission 
500,000 tonnes of CO2

80% the peak demand (MW) 
164

The reduction and containt placed on the wind potential (MW)
310

The composition of the wind potnetial after the constraint were as followed:
